# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## Overview

This project is a Plant Disease Detection System that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. The system provides a full-stack implementation with a backend responsible for model inference and a frontend that allows users to upload images and view predictions.

## Features

- Upload plant leaf images for disease prediction
- CNN-based image classification
- Backend API for processing predictions
- Frontend interface for user interaction
- Modular and scalable project structure


## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Flask or FastAPI
- React / HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Node.js and npm
